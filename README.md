Explanation of the Code:
Libraries: 
The code imports necessary libraries for data manipulation, visualization, and model building.
Data Exploration: 
The dataset is loaded, and a summary of the data and missing values is provided.
Data Cleaning: 
Missing values are handled, and a new feature ('HasCabin') is created. The irrelevant Cabin column is dropped.
Data Visualization: 
Visualizations are created to understand the distribution of the target variable and correlations between features.
Feature Engineering: 
Categorical variables are encoded, and irrelevant columns are dropped.
Data Preparation: 
The data is split into training and testing sets, and features are standardized.
Model Building: 
A Random Forest model is built and trained on the data.
Model Evaluation: 
The model's performance is evaluated using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report.
This code forms a complete project for predicting survival on the Titanic, including all essential steps.
